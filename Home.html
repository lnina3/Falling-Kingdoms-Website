<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p><strong>The gripping New York Times bestseller that is Game of Thrones for teens.</strong></p>
<p>In a land where magic has been forgotten but peace has reigned for centuries, a deadly unrest is simmering. Three kingdoms grapple for power—brutally transforming their subjects' lives in the process. Amidst betrayals, bargains, and battles, four young people find their fates forever intertwined.</p>
<ul>

<li>Cleo: A princess raised in luxury must embark on a rough and treacherous journey into enemy territory in search of a magic long thought extinct.</li>
<li>Jonas: Enraged at injustice, a rebel lashes out against the forces of oppression that have kept his country impoverished—and finds himself the leader of a people's revolution centuries in the making.</li>
<li>Lucia: A girl adopted at birth into a royal family discovers the truth about her past—and the supernatural legacy she is destined to wield.</li>
<li>Magnus: Bred for aggression and trained to conquer, a firstborn son begins to realize that the heart can be more lethal than the sword. . . .</li>

</ul>

<p>The only outcome that's certain is that kingdoms will fall. Who will emerge triumphant when all they know has collapsed?</p>

<h3>Rebel Spring</h3>
<p><strong>Love, power, and magic collide with war in the second book of the Falling Kingdoms series.</strong></p>
<p>Auranos has been conquered and the three kingdoms—Auranos, Limeros, and Paelsia—are now unwillingly united as one country called Mytica. But alluring, dangerous magic still beckons, and with it the chance to rule not just Mytica, but the world. . . .</p>
<ul>

<li>CLEO is now a prisoner in her own palace, forced to be an ambassador for Mytica as the evil King Gaius lies to her people.</li>
<li>MAGNUS stands to eventually inherit the new kingdom but is still obsessed with his feelings for his adopted sister Lucia.</li>
<li>LUCIA is haunted by the deadly outcome of her breathtaking display of magic that allowed her father to capture the kingdoms.</li>
<li>JONAS watches at the palace gates, a troop of rebels behind him, waiting for him to tell them how he plans to overtake King Gaius.</li>

</ul>

<p>When Gaius announces that a road is to be built into the Forbidden Mountains, formally linking all of Mytica together, he sets off a chain of cataclysmic events that will forever change the face of this land.</p>
