<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<h2><em>Book 1: Falling Kingdoms</em></h2>
<p><em>Falling Kingdoms</em> opens with Auranian princess Cleo and Lord Aron on an excursion to Paelsia in search of fine wine. After Lord Aron insults a wine seller's daughter, <span class = "spoiler">the situation ends in bloodshed when he kills the wine seller's son Tomas, who had leaped foward to defend his sister's honor. Tomas's brother Jonas vows to avenge his brother's murder and becomes obsessed with bringing both Aron and Cleo to justice, blaming Cleo especially for Tomas's death. He finds himself the leader of a rebellion that had been brewing for decades, given Paelsia's poverty and Auranos's seeming wealth and opulence.</span></p>
<p>Cleo is haunted by <span class = "spoiler">Tomas's death and wishes only to purge the memory from her mind. Soon however, her beloved sister Emilia has fallen ill to a disease no healer can name, so Cleo once again embarks on a desperate journey to Paelsia in search of magic grape seeds said to have healing ability. Meanwhile, in the third kingdome of Limeros, King Gaius uses the murder of Tomas as an excuse to ally with Paelsia to conquer Auranos. He is in truth searching for the Kindred, four magical crystals that hold the essence of the four elements and hold enormous power, but have been lost for centuries. King Gaius believes that the Kindred are in Auranos and intends to do anything in order to find them.</span></p>
<p>Gaius's strategy includes <span class = "spoiler"> his adopted daughter, Lucia, who was prophesied to be a sorceress. Her powers awaken and Gaius uses her to break down the magical protection spell at Auranos's gate. Once Auranos is captured, Gaius betrays and kills Paelsia's leader, claiming himself king of Auranos, Paelsia, and Limeros. Cleo is now the dethroned queen of Auranos, and she will do all she can to find the Kindred and take back her rightful place.</span></p>
